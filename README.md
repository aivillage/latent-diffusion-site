# AI Village's Latent Diffusion Demo

This is a little flask website that provides a clean way of demo-ing the [latent diffusion model](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion) and displaying all the art generated by the convention attendees. 

# Setup

First download the large model:
```
wget -O models/ldm/text2img-large/model.ckpt https://ommer-lab.com/files/latent-diffusion/nitro/txt2img-f8-large/model.ckpt
```

Then clone our [fork](https://github.com/aivillage/latent-diffusion) locally. The fork has the tested base docker image that this repo relies on. Then build that container (in that repo's local folder) with the following command:
```
docker build . -t ldm_base
```

After you can run `docker-compose up --build` to run this container locally. You will find the website at `localhost:5000`. It will output images to the image file here. Run this once with internet access so that HuggingFace's `transformers` library can cache it's bert model. After that, it can be run without internet access.
